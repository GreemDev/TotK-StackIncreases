Actual mod is in the `romfs` folder.
If you just want this repo as a TotK mod, delete everything but the `romfs` folder, and then drag the folder over TKMM to install it, or install it in your emulator of choice.

In the `plaintext` folder is a `.rstbl.yml` file that is the contents of the `.byml.zs` (Binary YAML, compressed with ZStandard, editable with [NxEditor](https://github.com/NX-Editor/NxEditor)).

Modifies the `romfs/RSDB/PouchActorInfo.Product.111.rstbl.byml.zs` game file.
